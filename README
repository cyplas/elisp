This repository consists of a few small extensions for GNU Emacs I
wrote in Emacs Lisp some years ago:

 - estate.el: logs aspects of Emacs state
 - fvwm-command.el: interface to FvwmCommand (and hence FVWM)
 - marker-ring.el: management of buffer-local marker rings
 - move-mode.el: minor mode for rapid read-only movement around buffers
 - toggle-option.el: easily toggle frequently toggled options
 - vocab-test.el: foreign language flashcard-style vocabulary-testing program

For installation and usage instructions, see the individual libraries.
